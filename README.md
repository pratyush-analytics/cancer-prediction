🧬 Cancer Prediction & Growth Rate Analysis (Excel Project)
✨ Project Overview
This Excel project is a non-programming-based tool designed to help researchers, students, and healthcare professionals analyze and predict the growth rate of cancer cells or tumors. By using statistical formulas and historical data, it simplifies the process of identifying potential trends in tumor progression.

🎯 Objectives
Data-Driven Prediction: Offer a simple, data-driven method for forecasting cancer growth rates.

Statistical Power: Leverage Excel's built-in formulas for calculations and predictions.

Dynamic Visualization: Use charts, graphs, and a summary dashboard to make complex data easy to understand.

Accessibility: Create a user-friendly tool that doesn't require any programming knowledge.

🚀 Features
1. Data Input Section
A dedicated sheet for entering raw data.

Columns: Patient ID, Date of Observation, Tumor Size (mm/cm³), and optional clinical variables like Age, Gender, and Treatment Type.

2. Growth Rate Calculation
Automated formulas calculate daily, weekly, or monthly growth rates.

Supports compound growth rate calculations for more accurate analysis.

3. Prediction Model
Uses linear trendline forecasting or exponential growth formulas to predict future tumor sizes.

Adjustable parameters in the Settings tab allow you to customize the model.

4. Visualization Tools
Dynamic charts that update automatically as you add new data.

Color-coded conditional formatting to visually highlight high-risk growth patterns.

Interactive line charts with data labels for clarity.

5. Summary Dashboard
A clean, easy-to-read dashboard summarizing key insights.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Average Growth Rate

Predicted Tumor Size

Risk Category

🔢 Methodology
Data Collection
Data is gathered from clinical studies, medical records, or simulated datasets.

Preprocessing
Simple data cleaning tasks like removing duplicates and handling missing values are performed directly in Excel.

Growth Rate Formula
The core calculation uses a basic growth rate formula:

Growth Rate (%)= 
Previous Size
Current Size−Previous Size
​
 ×100
Prediction Model
The tool applies Excel's FORECAST.LINEAR or GROWTH function to estimate future tumor sizes based on historical trends.

🛠️ How to Use
Open the Excel file.

Go to the Data Input sheet and enter your patient data.

Navigate to the Growth Analysis sheet to view calculated growth rates and averages.

The Dashboard sheet will automatically populate with charts and summary statistics.

Adjust the prediction duration or model type (linear vs. exponential) in the Settings tab.

⚠️ Limitations & Disclaimer
Not for Medical Diagnosis: This is an analytical and educational model. It should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice or a diagnostic tool.

Data Quality is Key: The accuracy of predictions is highly dependent on the quality and quantity of the input data.

Simplistic Modeling: This model is best for short- to medium-term predictions due to the inherent limitations of using Excel for complex biological modeling.
